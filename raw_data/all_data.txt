{"name": "Final Portrait", "synopsis": "In 1964, while on a short trip to Paris, the American writer and art-lover James Lord (Armie Hammer) is asked by his friend, the world-renowned artist Alberto Giacometti (Geoffrey Rush), to sit for a portrait. The process, Giacometti assures Lord, will take only a few days. Flattered and intrigued, Lord agrees. So begins not only the story of an offbeat friendship, but, seen through the eyes of Lord, an insight into the beauty, frustration, profundity and, at times, downright chaos of the artistic process. FINAL PORTRAIT is a portrait of a genius, and of a friendship between two men who are utterly different, yet increasingly bonded through a single, ever-evolving act of creativity. It is a film which shines a light on the artistic process itself, by turns exhilarating, exasperating and bewildering, questioning whether the gift of a great artist is a blessing or a curse.", "year": 2017, "genres": ["Biography", "Comedy", "Drama"], "cover": "https://yts.am/assets/images/movies/final_portrait_2017/medium-cover.jpg", "rating": {"likes": 1, "imdb": 6.3, "Critics": "78%", "Audience": "93%"}, "download": {"links": {"quality": "1080p.WEB", "url": "https://yts.am/torrent/download/4CBC709CFCA4D7C86111C216B82C135F1CC570EC"}}, "similar_movies": [], "screenshots": ["https://yts.am/assets/images/movies/final_portrait_2017/large-screenshot1.jpg", "https://yts.am/assets/images/movies/final_portrait_2017/large-screenshot2.jpg", "https://yts.am/assets/images/movies/final_portrait_2017/large-screenshot3.jpg"], "directors": [{"name": "Stanley Tucci", "photo": "https://yts.am/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0001804.jpg", "url": "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001804/"}], "actors": [{"name": {"original": "Armie Hammer", "appeared_as": "James Lord"}, "photo": "https://yts.am/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm2309517.jpg", "url": "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2309517/"}, {"name": {"original": "Geoffrey Rush", "appeared_as": "Alberto Giacometti"}, "photo": "https://yts.am/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0001691.jpg", "url": "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001691/"}, {"name": {"original": "Clemence Poesy", "appeared_as": "Caroline"}, "photo": "", "url": "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0993242/"}, {"name": {"original": "Tony Shalhoub", "appeared_as": "Diego Giacometti"}, "photo": "https://yts.am/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0001724.jpg", "url": "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001724/"}], "trailer": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWkS1gO3aNI?rel=0&wmode=transparent&border=0&autoplay=1&iv_load_policy=3"}

{"name": "Final Portrait", "synopsis": "In 1964, while on a short trip to Paris, the American writer and art-lover James Lord (Armie Hammer) is asked by his friend, the world-renowned artist Alberto Giacometti (Geoffrey Rush), to sit for a portrait. The process, Giacometti assures Lord, will take only a few days. Flattered and intrigued, Lord agrees. So begins not only the story of an offbeat friendship, but, seen through the eyes of Lord, an insight into the beauty, frustration, profundity and, at times, downright chaos of the artistic process. FINAL PORTRAIT is a portrait of a genius, and of a friendship between two men who are utterly different, yet increasingly bonded through a single, ever-evolving act of creativity. It is a film which shines a light on the artistic process itself, by turns exhilarating, exasperating and bewildering, questioning whether the gift of a great artist is a blessing or a curse.", "year": 2017, "genres": ["Biography", "Comedy", "Drama"], "cover": "https://yts.am/assets/images/movies/final_portrait_2017/medium-cover.jpg", "rating": {"likes": 1, "imdb": 6.3, "Critics": "78%", "Audience": "93%"}, "download": {"links": {"quality": "1080p.WEB", "url": "https://yts.am/torrent/download/4CBC709CFCA4D7C86111C216B82C135F1CC570EC"}}, "similar_movies": [], "screenshots": ["https://yts.am/assets/images/movies/final_portrait_2017/large-screenshot1.jpg", "https://yts.am/assets/images/movies/final_portrait_2017/large-screenshot2.jpg", "https://yts.am/assets/images/movies/final_portrait_2017/large-screenshot3.jpg"], "directors": [{"name": "Stanley Tucci", "photo": "https://yts.am/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0001804.jpg", "url": "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001804/"}], "actors": [{"name": {"original": "Armie Hammer", "appeared_as": "James Lord"}, "photo": "https://yts.am/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm2309517.jpg", "url": "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2309517/"}, {"name": {"original": "Geoffrey Rush", "appeared_as": "Alberto Giacometti"}, "photo": "https://yts.am/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0001691.jpg", "url": "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001691/"}, {"name": {"original": "Clemence Poesy", "appeared_as": "Caroline"}, "photo": "", "url": "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0993242/"}, {"name": {"original": "Tony Shalhoub", "appeared_as": "Diego Giacometti"}, "photo": "https://yts.am/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0001724.jpg", "url": "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001724/"}], "trailer": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWkS1gO3aNI?rel=0&wmode=transparent&border=0&autoplay=1&iv_load_policy=3"}

There, after a chance encounter with the always boozy but merciful Father Tommasso, the young charmer will find refuge into his convent's sanctuary, on one condition: to pretend he is a deaf-mute. However, Massetto's tempting presence will unavoidably upset the already frail balance of things within the sexually-repressed female realm, as nun after nun desperately seeks an escape from their tedious way of life and an extra reason to molest the charming handyman. In the end, will those cloistered Sisters finally find out what they had been missing out on all these years?", "year": 2017, "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "cover": "https://yts.am/assets/images/movies/the_little_hours_2017/medium-cover.jpg", "rating": {"likes": 4, "imdb": 5.9, "Critics": "77%", "Audience": "56%"}, "download": {"links": {"quality": "1080p.BluRay", "url": "https://yts.am/torrent/download/6EC6852A86E353E9961D7090CC23CBCDD0A321BD"}}, "similar_movies": [], "screenshots": ["https://yts.am/assets/images/movies/the_little_hours_2017/large-screenshot1.jpg", "https://yts.am/assets/images/movies/the_little_hours_2017/large-screenshot2.jpg", "https://yts.am/assets/images/movies/the_little_hours_2017/large-screenshot3.jpg"], "directors": [{"name": "Jeff Baena", "photo": "", "url": "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1337885/"}], "actors": [{"name": {"original": "Alison Brie", "appeared_as": "Alessandra"}, "photo": "https://yts.am/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm1555340.jpg", "url": "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1555340/"}, {"name": {"original": "Nick Offerman", "appeared_as": "Lord Bruno"}, "photo": "https://yts.am/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm0644406.jpg", "url": "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0644406/"}, {"name": {"original": "Aubrey Plaza", "appeared_as": "Fernanda"}, "photo": "https://yts.am/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm2201555.jpg", "url": "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2201555/"}, {"name": {"original": "Dave Franco", "appeared_as": "Massetto"}, "photo": "https://yts.am/assets/images/actors/thumb/nm2002649.jpg", "url": "http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2002649/"}], "trailer": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/x-k7GY-0ugs?rel=0&wmode=transparent&border=0&autoplay=1&iv_load_policy=3"}
